# General Stuff to Know

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: O(n log n)
- **for/while loops**: O(n)
- **Powerset**: O(2^n)

## Space Complexity
- **Variables**: Non-index variables - O(1)
- **Index**:
  - 1-dimensional: O(n)
  - 2-dimensional arrays: O(n^2)

## Fundamental Data Structures
- **Arrays/Lists**: Fundamental data structures for storing ordered elements.
- **Strings**: Sequence of characters, often manipulated for pattern matching, searching, etc.
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure used for problems involving recursion, parsing expressions, etc.
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure used for scheduling tasks, BFS, etc.
- **Hash Tables**: Data structure that provides fast insertion, deletion, and lookup using hash functions.
- **Linked Lists**: Linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations; elements are linked using pointers.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical data structure with a root node and children nodes forming a tree-like structure.
- **Graphs**: Collection of nodes connected by edges, used to represent various networks.

## Algorithms
- **Sliding Window**: Technique for finding subarrays/substrings that satisfy a condition, used for problems involving contiguous sequences.
- **Backtracking**: Recursive approach for exploring all possible solutions, commonly used in constraint satisfaction problems.
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level, used for shortest path and connectivity problems.
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, used for pathfinding and connectivity problems.
- **Hashing**: Technique for mapping data to a fixed size using hash functions, used for fast data retrieval.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, used for optimization problems.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Method for solving problems by making the locally optimal choice at each step, used for optimization problems.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Technique for solving problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and combining their solutions.
- **Binary Search**: Algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, used for search problems.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Techniques for solving problems related to graph data structures, including:
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from a single source to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
  - **A* Search**: Finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node using heuristics.
  - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Finds the minimum spanning tree in a graph.
  - **Prim's Algorithm**: Finds the minimum spanning tree in a graph.
- **Union-Find**: Data structure for keeping track of disjoint sets, used in network connectivity and dynamic connectivity problems.
- **Topological Sort**: Ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph, used in scheduling problems.
